<p>If you&#39;re a new parent, one of the first things on your list will be finding the perfect baby bag. With so many different options available, it can be tough to know which one is right for you. We&#39;ve put together this comprehensive review of the best baby bags of 2022. From traditional nappy bags to stylish baby backpacks, we&#39;ve got you covered! So whether you&#39;re looking for something functional or something a little more fashionable, read on for our top recommendations.</p>

<p>Before we dive into our review, let&#39;s first look at some of the things you should keep in mind when choosing a baby bag.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong>: One of the most important considerations is size. You want to make sure that the bag is large enough to fit all of your baby&#39;s essentials but not so large that it becomes cumbersome to carry.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong>: Another important consideration is storage. Look for a bag with plenty of compartments and pockets to help keep you organised.</p>

<p><strong>Style</strong>: Of course, you also want to consider style <p><a href="https://www.colettehayman.com.au/collections/baby-bags">baby bags</a></p>
. Do you want a traditional diaper bag or something a little more stylish?</p>

<p><strong>Tote or a backpack</strong>: You will also need to decide whether you want a tote or a backpack. Tote bags are typically more stylish, but backpacks can be easier to carry, especially if you have multiple children.</p>
